# Appwrite Setup for NutriSuppliers Image Upload

## üîß Required Configuration

You need to update the Appwrite configuration in `client/src/lib/appwrite.ts` with your actual project details.

### 1. Update Configuration Constants

Replace these placeholders in `client/src/lib/appwrite.ts`:

```typescript
// TODO: Replace these with your actual Appwrite project details
const APPWRITE_ENDPOINT = 'https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1'; // Your Appwrite endpoint
const APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID = 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'; // Your project ID
const APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID = 'YOUR_BUCKET_ID'; // Your storage bucket ID
```

### 2. Get Your Project Details

#### Project ID:
1. Go to your Appwrite Console
2. Select your project
3. Copy the Project ID from the project overview

#### Bucket ID:
1. In your Appwrite project, go to "Storage"
2. Select your storage bucket
3. Copy the Bucket ID from the bucket settings

#### Endpoint:
- If using Appwrite Cloud: `https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1`
- If self-hosted: Your custom Appwrite server URL + `/v1`

### 3. Configure Storage Bucket Permissions

In your Appwrite Console:

1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí Your Bucket
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Configure **Permissions**:
   - **Create**: `users` (authenticated users can upload)
   - **Read**: `users` (authenticated users can view)
   - **Update**: `users` (authenticated users can modify)
   - **Delete**: `users` (authenticated users can delete)

### 4. File Upload Settings

In your bucket settings, configure:

- **Maximum File Size**: 10MB (or your preferred limit)
- **Allowed File Extensions**: `jpg, jpeg, png, webp, gif`
- **Antivirus**: Enable if available
- **Encryption**: Enable for security

### 5. CORS Configuration (if needed)

If you encounter CORS issues:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Add your domain (e.g., `localhost:5173` for development)
3. Or configure in your Appwrite server settings

## üîê Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Images are only accessible to authenticated users
- Each user can only access images from their own transactions
- Implement proper user session management

### File Validation
- Client-side validation for file type and size
- Server-side validation in Appwrite functions (optional)
- Antivirus scanning for uploaded files

### Storage Optimization
- Images are automatically compressed before upload
- Preview images are generated at different sizes
- Consider implementing image cleanup for deleted transactions
